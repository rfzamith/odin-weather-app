## My process

### Built with

- HTML: Semantic Elements
- CSS: Flexbox, Animation Keyframes, Weather Icons
- JavaScript
 
### Future improvements

- Use the user's current location as default location in the weather app, when loading the first time.
- Add a settings panel, where the user can change the language and the unit system unit from celsius to fahrenheit.

Great opportunity to continue to expand my knowledge of CSS, JavaScript and DOM manipulation. This was a very enjoyable project, very challenging
